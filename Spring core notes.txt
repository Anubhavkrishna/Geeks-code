Spring Framework In Java( Spring core)

>Dependency Injection/IOC- A method of implementing the idea of loose coupling among the different objects of 
different classes.
Reducing the dependency of one object upon another.

> use of spring framework/Inversion of Control
The changes will be made into the xml file without changing the java code, so the need to recompile 
the java code is minimised.
- object creation will be taken care by spring framework. 
  - we have a config file which contains a list of classes whose objects has to be created.
  - IOC container- holds the objects of the classes defined in the config file.
     reads the config file, creates the object and stores it.
  - the objects in the ioc container are referred to as beans.
> IOC container
   2 types of IOC container
   1) Application Context.
   2) Bean Factory (A subset of Application context)
  - both of the above are interfaces.
> the getbean() method used to get the object created by the IOC container.

> Dependency Injection- the data or the value of the variables is referred as the dependency.
 way to avoid hardcoding, instead of hardcoding the data, the data is passed using the xml file.
 dependency types- literal, collection and objective dependency.
 

  -- setter injection- dependency injection using setter method defined by the developer
   using the property tag
  -- constructor injection-
   using the constructor-arg tag

> Creating object using new keyword is a method of using tight coupling.
